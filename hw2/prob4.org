* Problem 4
** a
i and j are equal to the rows and columns of the vectors respectively.

$$x^T A x = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{j,i} x_i x_j$$

** b
Let x be all vectors such that we have all vectors that have a 1 in one specific place and zero in all the others. For example,

\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 0\\ 0\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 1\\ 0\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 0\\ 0\\ 1\end{bmatrix}

But continued for the length of N so that we can perform x^T A x. These vectors exist so that they can extract the diagonal values of matrix A. Given that x^T A x is necessarily greater than 0 for all non-zero vectors x, the diagonal elements of A have to be positive or else we've invalidated the fact that x^T A x > 0.


The only way that x^T A x can be negative or zero, is if A diagonal values are negative or zero. This proves if A diagonals are positive, A is positive definite.
