* Problem 3

** Part a
k(x,y) = (\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i +c )^2

= ((x_1 y_1 +c) + ... + (x_n y_n + c))^2

= x_1^2 y_1^2 + 2 x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 + x_2^2 + x_2^2 + 2c x_1 y_1 + ... + c^2

or expressed as a dot product of the vectors

= (x_1^2, ...., x_n^2, y_1^2, ...., y_n^2, \sqrt{2}x_{n-2} x_{n-1}, ..., \sqrt{2c} x_n, c)

** Part b
Cross validation and leveraging that to tune hyperparameters. We want to get something that generalizes well and doesn't just minimize the empirical risk but rather the generalized risk.
