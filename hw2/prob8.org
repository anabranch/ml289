* Problem 8
** Part a

** Part b
If there is no loss when choosing doubt, the risk minimization that takes place will mean that the lowest risk choice is always doubt - making our algorithm useless. If the doubt cost is greater than the mis-classification cost then our algorithm will always take a guess at classifying the example and will never go with doubt. This is a way of forcing our algorithm to take a guess and what class something should belong to.
