* Problem 1 Solution
CDF = \int f(x) dx

= \int \tfrac{2}{\pi(1+x^2)}dx

= \tfrac{2}{\pi}\int \tfrac{2}{1+x^2}dx

= \tfrac{2}{\pi}tan^{-1}(x)

Now we just need to evaluate this for each interval. Keep in mind that each of these need to be multiplied by 2/\pi.

tan^{-1}(0) = 0

tan^{-1}(1/\sqrt{3}) = \pi/6

tan^{-1}(1) = \pi/4

tan^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) = \pi/3

-----

We know that \int_a_b f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a). So we can use that to get our probabilities.

-----

For the interval from 0 -> 1/\sqrt{3}

2/\pi * \pi/6 - 0 = 2/6


-----

For the interval from 1/\sqrt{3} -> 1

2/\pi * \pi/4 - 2/\pi * \pi/6 = 1/6


-----

For the interval from 1 -> \sqrt{3}

2/\pi * \pi/3 - 2/\pi * \pi/4 = 1/6


Now that we have those values we can go about calculating the expectation which is simply the probabilities of each of those happening (that we calculated above) multiplied by the point values in order to get the expected value.

4/6 + 3/6 + 2/6 = \tfrac{13}{6}
