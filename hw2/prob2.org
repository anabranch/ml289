* Problem 2

All sums/products are over N.

P(x_i | \theta) = \theta e^{-\theta x}

lik(\theta) = \prod^n p(x_i |\theta)

= \sum log(p(x_i |\theta))

= \sum log(\theta) - \theta x_i

= n log(\theta) - \sum \theta x_i

-----

Now we can set the derivative equal to 0 to get the maximum likelihood.

max. lik(\theta) = \partial y / \partial \theta = 0

-----

= \tfrac{\partial n log(\theta) - \sum \theta x_i}{\partial \theta} = 0

= n/\theta - \sum x_i = 0

= \tfrac{n}{\theta} = \sum x_i

= n/ \sum x_i = \theta

= \tfrac{5}{5.7} = \theta
